# Shopping-Cart-Angular
This is a basic shopping cart application built with `AngularJS` and `Node`. This app features multiple views for the
shopping cart, checking-out items and making purchases. You can add items to your shopping cart and the cart will update
with the total price. When you go to checkout, the list of items and prices will be displayed.

When you click on purchase, you will be taken to the order form, where you fill in information. Using Angular, all form fields are validated.
